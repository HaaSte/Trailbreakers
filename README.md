# TrailbreakersPlugins
This is a repository that contains my most up-to-date Trailbreakers content.

This also houses the official mod loading library, a modified version of BepInEx (https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx)

All of the content that you find here is generally still a work in progress and should be expected to have limited functionality or simply have bugs.

Due to the lack of information here, if you have any questions, feel free to message me on the official Trailmakers Discord (https://www.discord.gg/Trailmakers).
